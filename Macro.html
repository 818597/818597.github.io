	<h3>What is Macro Play?</h3>
	<p>
	Macro play is pushing your advantages outside of your lane and onto the rest of the map. Teleporting bot lane to assist your botlaners in a fight is a good example of Macro Play. The thought process should be similar to this surrounding Macro Play: "(Action) was done/is going to be done, which will (effect), allowing us/them or preventing us/them to/from (reaction).
