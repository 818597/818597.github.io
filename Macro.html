	<h3>What is Macro Play?</h3>
	<p>
	Macro play is pushing your advantages outside of your lane and onto the rest of the map. Teleporting bot lane to assist your botlaners in a fight is a good example of Macro Play. The thought process should be similar to this surrounding Macro Play: "(Action) was done/is going to be done, which will (effect), allowing us/them or preventing us/them to/from (reaction)." By using this thought process you will be able to effectively determine whether or not you should attempt a Macro Play.

	<h3>Why is Macro Play Important?</h3>
		<p>If you are able to make plays on the entire map and get your whole team ahead, your chances of winning. Slow pushing your wave gives you an opportunity to roam on the map. Teleporting to another lane or objective is the most ideal way to participate in fights on the map. If you are not taking teleport, you will need to push your wave even earlier to compensate for the time it will take for you to arrive at the objective.
