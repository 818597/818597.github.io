	<h1>Top Lane Intro</h1>
	<hr>

	<p>
	Top lane is a solo lane in the video game League of Legends. It is often refered as the least impactful role in the game, because of the isolation that the lane provides from the rest of the game. However, the role can be quite impactful if the player knows how to manage the minion wave and make plays on the rest of the map (Macro Play).

  <h3>Champion Types</h3>
	<p>
		Virtually every type of champion can be played in the top lane, however, Juggernauts (characters that build health and attack damage or ability power) and Tanks are the most common. There are many ranged champions that can be played top lane, and they are often picked as a counterpick in certain matchups. Top lane is the most counterpick heavy lane, where the lane playstyle is decided by the champion matchup. </p>

	<h3>Summoner Spells</h3>
		<p>
		Teleport and Flash are the most common summoner spells that are taken in top lane. Flash is a universal spell taken on nearly every champion in the game, due to its utility and versatility. Teleport is a summoner spell that is very versatile as it allows for the player to easily make plays across that map. This is important as it is oftentimes difficult to leave top lane for team plays. The use of other summoner spells is situational to each champion and lane matchup, but most of the time a top laner should take Flash and Teleport.
